        Hey there! I’m Pei – a self-taught iOS engineer who somehow ended up
        with a business degree from Berkeley Haas. While my classmates were
        mastering the art of networking and ROI, I was busy staring at Xcode,
        wrangling Swift, copying and pasting error to Chatgpt at 3 AM. As a
        proud non-CS student, I spend my days obsessing over data structures,
        algorithms, and design patterns—basically all the stuff I never had to
        worry about in business school. Who needs finance when you have
        frameworks, right? When I’m not glued to my screen (which, let’s be
        honest, isn’t often), I enjoy the finer things in life—like spoiling my
        dogs, splurging on yet another mechanical keyboard, and attempting to
        convince my guitar that I actually know how to play it. If you’re
        looking for someone who codes apps and drinks too much coffee you’re in
        the right place. Let’s build something cool!
